                        <p className="p1">Lillian Parker, a zookeeper turned Software Engineer graduated from West Texas A&M University with a Bachelors of Science in Wildlife Biology. With a degree and a passion for herpetofauna by her side, she began working at at an Aquarium in the reptile department, and rose through the ranks quickly until she was promoted to a Lead. From there she and her team revolutionized the department and all the herpetofauna within their care.</p>
