# HerpKeeper
HerpKeeper is an online directory for keepers to maintain records of the herpetofauna within their collections. Every herp keeper has lost parts of a record here and there to water stains, blood, or worse enough, musk. And so, a keeper turned software engineer turned a fleeting thought into a reality. From vet records to feeding schedules, HerpKeeper has the ability to keep your records away from the soiling and mess that some herps decide to bestow on you, and in a less messy place.
